  \label{cha:abstract}
\vspace{72pt}

Digital system design is the process of creating a complex digital system by building and integrating various fundamental components.  In this lab, multiplexers and decoders are implemented to familiarize students with the operation of an FPGA device and the Altera development environment.  Testbenches are used to demonstrate the power and usefulness of simulations.  The simple elements designed in this lab can be used as basic components in much larger, more complicated designs.  It is critical to grasp the scope and scalability of this technology.  This lab also focuses on connecting smaller components to make larger more complicated processes simpler.  The final part of this lab, the 5 piece seven-segment decoder is the culmination of these principles.

\section*{\scshape Introduction} %(0.5 pages)
\label{cha:introduction}

Lab one is broken into four distinct subsystems.  Each system is standalone and can be simulated through ModelSim for testing and also implemented on the Altera DE 2 FPGA board.  The first system is a 2-to-1 multiplexer with an 8-bit input/output.  The second system is a modification of the first.  It expands the multiplexer to a 5-to-1 but decreases the input/output channel size to 3 bits.  The third system is a seven segment display implementation do display the letters 'T', 'I', 'G', 'E', and 'R'.  The fourth and final system is a combination of the previous two.  The design uses a 5-to-1 multiplexer with 5 seven segment displays.  The seven segment displays are capable of showing a rotating string based upon input values defined by the engineer.  Each of these systems is comparable to real-world counterparts.  They are an analogy to other systems in which complex designs are built from smaller, simpler components.

\section{\scshape 2-to-1 Multiplexer} %(0.5 pages)
\label{sec:2to1}

\subsection{\scshape Design of the 2-to-1 Multiplexer}
\label{sub:design_2to1}

Building the 2-to-1 multiplexer system in VHDL requires 3 signals: a select signal, an 8-bit input channel, and an 8-bit output channel.  Once those are defined the engineer has multiple options on how to implement the functionality. Figure \ref{fig:logic_2to1} shows the digital logic implementation of the first system.  By using the powerful non-linearity of VHDL the entire behavior of the multiplexer can be implemented in one simple if-then-else block (Figure \ref{fig:code_2to1}).

\end{figure}

    \caption{2-to-1 Multiplexer Logic}
    \label{fig:logic_2to1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\scshape Testing of the 2-to-1 Multiplexer}
\label{sec:test_2to1}

Testing of the multiplexer was done with a testbench through ModelSim.  Inside the test bench the input signals were initialized and set to different values.  Next, the channels were cycled through using the select signal.  Once cycled, the signal that was selected was changed and the change was verified through the Wave view in ModelSim.  Finally, the signal that was not selected was changed and monitored to make sure the output did not change.

Once the testbench was completed, the code was compiled inside of Quartus II and flashed onto the Cyclone IV FPGA.  Once the code was loaded onto the FPGA the switches and LEDS were used to verify the operation of the code.  For this multiplexer design, the switches 15 to 8 were used for the Y channel and switched 7 to 0 were used for X.  Switch 16 was used as the select signal and the red LEDs were connected to the output channel.  By toggling through the earlier mentioned states, the program was verified in hardware.

\section{\scshape 5-to-1 Multiplexer} % (fold)
\label{sec:5to1}

\subsection{\scshape Designing the 5-to-1 Multiplexer} % (fold)
\label{sub:design_5to1}

The second system was a 5-to-1 multiplexer design.  This design is very similar to the previous system.  The addition of three more channels will require a more complex decoding algorithm.  This can complicate the design greatly; however, smart implementation techniques can limit the overhead of the computation.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:5to1code} a simple case block was sufficient to perform the select signal decoding for the 3 bit select line.  This method is inefficient with larger select lines as they exponentially increase the number of required cases per select channel bit.

\end{figure}

\subsection{\scshape Testing the 5-to-1 Multiplexer} % (fold)
\label{sub:test_5to1}

The testing of the 5-to-1 multiplexer was almost exactly the same as the test for the 2-to-1.  Figure \ref{fig:timing_1b} shows the timing diagram of the signals.  The diagram shows the transition from the output signal (TESTM) as the select signal (TESTS) is modified.  The first 5 changes for TESTS show the value of the output matching the selected input.  The second to last change shows that non-selected input does not affect the output.  The final change to TESTW when it is selected shows that the output changes immediately with the selected signal.

\section{\scshape Seven Segment Decoder}
\label{sec:seven_segment_decoder}

\subsection{\scshape Designing the Seven Segment Decoder} % (fold)
\label{sub:design_ssd}

\vspace{30px}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{ssd}
    \caption{Seven Segment Display Logic}
    \label{fig:ssd}
\end{figure}

The basic truth table and signal layout for the seven segment decoder (SSD) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssd}.  The SSD is supposed to take a 3-bit input and display a letter corresponding to the values in the truth table.  This means that a maximum of $2^3$  Each segment in the decoder is set by a bit.  So the input channel must be 7 bits wide to accommodate the SSD.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{timing_ssd}
    \caption{Seven Segment Timing Waveform}
    \label{fig:timing_ssd}
\end{figure}

Testing of the SSD is more efficient on the Cyclone IV due to the nature of the visual display.  For a human eye the waveform simulation was unfortunately hard to follow.  Although the waveform allowed for proper logical adjustments, it was unknown that the SSD required a low bit to activate a segment and all of the letters were inverted.  Figure \ref{fig:timing_ssd} shows the timing waveform.

\section{\scshape 5-Seven Segment Display}
\label{sec:5_ssd}

\subsection{\scshape Designing the 5-Seven Segment Display} % (fold)
\label{sub:design_5_ssd}

The final system of Lab 1 is a 5-count SSD that can display a word.  The word must be able to be shifted by a 3-bit select channel and each letter must be modifiable by another 3-bit select channel.  Each of the previous subsystems is included for the final design.  There are 5 5-to-1 multiplexers which are connected to SSDs.   

\vspace{30px}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{5_ssd_truth}
    \caption{5 Seven Segment Truth Table}
    \label{fig:5_ssd_truth}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:5_ssd_truth} shows the truth table for the select line input.  This table is assuming that the SSD letter codes are not changing when the select line does.  Each SSD also has a 3-bit select line that will tell the multiplexer what values to send to the decoder.  The diagram for the signals is shown in Figure \ref{fig:5_ssd_logic}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{5_ssd_logic}
    \caption{5 Seven Segment Logic}
    \label{fig:5_ssd_logic}
\end{figure}
\vspace{15px}

\subsection{\scshape Testing the 5-Seven Segment Display}
\label{sub:test_5_ssd}

As the complexity of a system grows, so does the complexity of its verification.  The final system in lab 1 required multiple tests between components and tests of the components themselves to verify functionality.  For the test, the SSD were initialized to display "TIGER".  Then the letters were permuted through the TESTSW signal.  Once that was verified, the letters were randomized and then permuted randomly through the SSDs.  In the code the "default" value for the SSD was set to display the number "8" for easy debugging.

The code for the testbench can be seen in Appendix B.  The waveform simulation can be found in Appendix C.

\section{\scshape Conclusions} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusions}

This lab is a testament to the modularity, reliability, and scope of FPGA programming with VHDL.  Simple components or systems can be designed and connected to form incredibly complex systems that can perform a wide range of actions.  Originally, the subsystems in the lab seemed unconnected to one another.  However, by the end of the lab it was clear that the systems were building upon each other.  This lab also clearly demonstrated the value of simulations in attempting to analyze complex FPGA systems.
